# Power-BI

This project used a dataset to look at some trends on World Cup matches (e.g. Goals scored by team and at different World Cups).
The focus is on familiarity of Power BI.

To visualise this, I transformed data, unpivoting columns in the process and adding new conditional columns and measures.
Once this was done I used the new measures and columns to aid in the visualisation of data.
